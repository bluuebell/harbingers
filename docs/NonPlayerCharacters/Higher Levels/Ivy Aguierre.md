### Non Player Character Story
 - she is actually the daughter of Giovanni

> What do we have here, the prodigal daughter returned, have you come to right past wrongs, to atone for your past misdeeds, or simply to gloat with your privilege. 
> 
> Do you not recognize the consequence of your Failures? Look at me, do you see these scars, here and here and here. they are your fault. I suffered day and night because of you. The rituals, the blood, the pain. Gods how it hurt. And all because you were to precious, to selfish to do what had to be done. You owe me a life. 
> 
> All the gifts of the gods were laid in your lap and you squandered them, shirked your duty, failed us. But I, I stepped up when you wouldn't, I suffered in your stead. Do you even know what sacrifice feels like? You are pathetic, you disgust me. I hate you.
