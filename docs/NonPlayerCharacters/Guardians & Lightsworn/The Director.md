### Non Player Character Notes
 - 0815 elf gesicht, really unimpressive and unmemorable, he has spent hundreds of years perfecting it
	 - pinker air/fire genasi
 - leader of the [[Lightsworn]]
 - founded the [[Blinding Knives]], took in [[Aya]] and [[Ash]]
 - is on the [[Aeneiros Birthday Party]]
 - enemy of [[Recordkeeper]] and [[Archivist]]

### Non Player Character Story
 - crackpot idea: The Director is a rogue changeling who wants power
 - has changelings who help him, who dont want the purpose and want their own lives, -> the changening
 - the purpose is limiting & they could just rule the city
