  ghost: "When Sorrel seemingly abandoned him to the nightmares of his new powers, and he was all alone -> surely the Lightsworn are the good guys after all."
  lie: "That the world is just and the lower classes deserve what they get. That the Lightsworn and Guardians are doing good."
  need: "To find Sorrel, to realise he was trying to do good."
  want: "Finding Sorrel and clearing up whatever happened. The approval of his parents."

  beliefs: "That the Lightsworn are hiding something from him, maybe he was wrong all along, not quite there yet - still kind of believes the lies the Council is telling & that upholding the current order is important, but is wavering. "
  behaviour: "A bit of an arrogant prick who sometimes overestimates himself. But if he puts his mind to something he will do it, whatever it costs him. Works well under stress."
