### Non Player Character Story
 Turns out this is [Shady Patch](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/arvellas-greengremlin/a/shady-patch-person), who negotiated with them on the smuggling route many many years ago, and was one of the first contacts of the frogs with the outside world who didn't hurt them, but instead brought gifts. They started to revere him as a god or saint.  
When they go to shady patch and ask him, he tells them:- when he was younger he was poor and joined the shades, a small gang from shade street.
- together with Yzera, expanded the operation
- negotiated the deal with the frogs, he speaks their language somewhat
- wanted to help people more than get money during uprising, Yzera had other ideas and would only help rebels/refugees as long as there was something in it for her - for a while, the renegades paid the shades to use their route to escape/hide, however she also let the guardians use it if they paid enough. Shady Patch was pissed at this and just let them through, Yzera threw him out because he disobeyed orders. So he joined the renegades for a time, and he knows that there were plans to make several hiding places across the island, but doesnt know exactly where they are.
- he marked some spots he thought maybe are places, on a map, but three droplets took it?
