### Non Player Character Story
 - the renegades went down into the tunnels about 16 years ago
 - before that:
	 - after sorrel was captured, renegades kind of fell apart
	 - amaranth trusted no one anymore, since lirion betrayed them
	 - joining the renegades became harder, and she formed the inner circle
	 - her plans became more aggressive. after famine started she tried to recruite more angry people
	 - not only made public appearances and speeches but also started riots and stuff
	 - stole weapons
	 - very aggressive
 - [x] when did ginger join
	 - he was younger than the others and wanted to prove himself, a new member when the stuff with sorrel happened
	 - did everything amaranth wanted and soon became her protege
	 - angry teenager
- then the riots came to a head 2 years into the famine, they had basically taken over parts of level 2 and 3, with a kind of shaky alliance with the shades (only helped them for their own gain)
- then one night the guardians came and took people from their houses, shades members, renegades, random people, and took them away. they were all publicly executed the next day. Most renegades were captured at this point and were killed
- amaranth took the rest and put the emergency plan into motion with the puzzles, where no one person knew where to find the others, and except for those who kept the puzzle the others left. only amaranth knew the entire thing
- this was ~15 years ago

##### After they enter the caves
- the caves were pretty weird, these crystals growing everywhere (when hit with a spell they explode)
- but they found this cave, with the path that spirals down and the small rooms going off of it looking like someone had lived there before
	- [x] what stuff did they find in the big cave #todo 
	- sometimes they would find old rusted weapons, and what looked like staffs with broken, darkened crystals buried in the ground
- they were safe for a time
- but they started having weird dreams of stuff staring at them, floating in a void, blood dripping upwards towards a light. some people started hearing voices
- it went on for a time, people being too scared to go outside, they all ate nothing but glowing mushrooms for a couple of months. After a couple of years some people had enough of the nightmares and weird stuff happening

- at this point, people wanted to leave. amaranth refused. 
	- she didnt want to leave, and would become more stubborn the more people wanted to leave
- some left, found different ways outside and didnt come back again
- some became very ill and like amaranth

### Renegades Split
- they split into several groups because they couldn't agree what to do
- they were disillusioned & defeated

##### Amaranth
- amaranth was stubborn and refused to go anywhere
	- she had a couple of the oldest members stay on her side

##### Exploring into the tunnels
- some wanted to go into the tunnels, and see what was causing the sickness & weird visions.
- lead by an owlin named ? and tyra, basil who was sick of sitting there becoming mad/sick

##### Go back up to the surface
-  tabaxi named Rosemary wanted to go back outside and just hide somewhere in level 1

### how they deal with madness
- ginger found some way for him and the others who were left to not become mad
- eat something weird? idk
- further down in the tunnels, there are flowers that glow golden in the dark. its very hard to grow them as they only grow in complete darkness but he managed to grow a very small amount in a small cave, but they dont have the same properties. however there is a cave not far where they grow
- (they only work if magic moths touch them or something)
- if you make a tea out of them it keeps the madness away?
- they also found if you take those crystals, and wear one, it keeps you safe. 
- amaranth refused both and still refuses.

### What happened to the others
##### Some went up to the surface again
- he doesnt really know where they went, they said they wanted to go to level 1 somewhere and then they left. he hasn't seen them since, has been a couple of yrs ago

##### Some went down
- a couple of years ago, before people went up, another splinter group wanted to explore down, through the tunnels
	- there is something there, you can sometimes hear noises, shuffling, stuff like that
	- ginger doesnt know what exactly was there
- amaranth let them go down once. they came back with only half the people they had left with, saying something big had attacked them in the dark.
- forbid them to go again
- this worked for a couple of months
- but after they went and left for good. they didnt come back, he doesnt know what happened to them
