### Non Player Character Notes


### Non Player Character Story

### Three Droplets on Stone (a.k.a. Droplets)

##### What the Council is doing

- council thinks maybe she is alive, and that either she is on her own or the shades have her
- they also have her family, so if they think she is on her own, they will threaten to kill them
- so they must think she is with the shades?
- SO what must happen is that Three Droplets gets attacked, knows the characters are nearby, contacts them somehow to make it seem like they have her captive (sends them a message along the lines of just play along) to make council think the shades have her captive so they don't kill her family

##### Characters in her Backstory

- Cover of Clouds (mother) and Four-Leaf Clover (little brother)
- Sarven Inassi (the Sun Elf who got her into project Horizon and who helped her at first as a partner, then forced her to be there)
- she also knows the Wraith, she once visited her to bring her a letter by her parents to show her they had them in custody
- HER LAB WAS IN LEVEL 5

##### Backstory

- Grew up in lower levels (3), worked her way up to university due to smort & wanted to build a flying machine - they didnt wanna accept her, when she was rejected an older Elf came up to her and was like oh you wanna study? okay prove it to me.
- he gave her a small note scribble with drawings and equatins and was like okay youre interested in engineering? wanna build your own flying machines? we could have some use for you... decipher this for me
- she deciphered it, it was a piece of sorrels notebook, about his aether engine
- given opportunity to work on secret governemnt project
- pick up where another had left off, had to decipher notes and build thing from them
- she didnt know then but since has found out a lot more about the [Project Horizon](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/arvellas-greengremlin/a/project-horizon-article?preview=true)
  
- project horizon. build better flying machines to get off the island, find other islands and more aether. She deciphered more and more of the notes, started building the engine alongside the notes
- however the notes became more and more dissheveled.
- There is like 2 parts to the notes. One part very orderly, about the aether engine, but only theoretical. the one she built from those notes exploded, killing some workers (they were not actually killed but turned into psycho powered people but she doesn tknow that)
- she wanted to stop at that point but she was reminded her family was relying on her (they knew where her brother and mother lived)
- 2 years into the project
  
- she continued but it was more forced now, she was not allowed to leave the lab for days on end, bla
- after some time, maybe another year later, someone knocked on her door at night and when she opened, there was no one there- but a umschlag. It contained a lot of information she had never seen. Most of it written in very scrawled handwriting, some of it math and drawings, some of it notes in a notebook. All in all:  
    
[Sorrel's Notes](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/arvellas-greengremlin/a/sorrel-s-notes-document?preview=true)- when she picked through the notes - which took her years - she finally found out what the one before had also found out: the council as planning to harvest the aether from island, but then it'll fall out of the sky
- she warned them but it was not believed, they said she only wants to get out so shes lying
  
- she left and destroyed her lab, faking her death & hoping no one will find her
- in the notes she found (sorrels notes) there was stuff talking abt the sanctuary
- found notes of something being inside the island where you can hide, and where you can be free. Decided to go there.
